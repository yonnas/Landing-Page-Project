# Landing Page Project


## Project Description:
This is the final Udacity project for the Frontend Web Development Fundamentals course. It requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Project Dependencies:
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: 
- to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and 
- to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. 


This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.
